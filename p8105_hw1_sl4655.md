*Problem 1*
===========

This problem is intended to emphasize variable types and introduce coercion; some awareness of how R treats numeric, character, and factor variables is necessary for working with these data types in practice.

### Create a data frame

-   a random sample of size 8 from a standard Normal distribution
-   a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
-   a character vector of length 8
-   a factor vector of length 8, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
# Create an original data frame
df_1 = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(8, mean = 0, sd = 1),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0,
  vec_character = c("James", "Benedict","Kate","Jennifer","Jake","Morgan","Martin","Natalie"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("B","A","C","B","B","A","C","C"))
)
```

##### Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works and what doesn’t?

``` r
# Take the mean of each variable
mean(pull(df_1, vec_numeric))
## [1] 0.2297973
mean(pull(df_1, vec_logical))
## [1] 0.625
mean(pull(df_1, vec_character))
## [1] NA
mean(pull(df_1, vec_factor))
## [1] NA
```

-   As we can see from above,
    -   the `mean()` function works for numeric and logic value (taking true as 1 and false as 0),
    -   it doesn't work on character vector and the factor, only returning `NA`.
        -   The reason is that the `mean()` function only works on numeric and logical vectors, and in this case the factors are in characters, so R make the factor and character vectors into a numeric vector

### Coersion as.numeric

In some cases, you can explicitly convert variables from one type to another. Write a code chunk that applies the `as.numeric` function to the logical, character, and factor variables (please show this chunk but not the output).

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df_1, vec_logical))
as.numeric(pull(df_1, vec_character))
as.numeric(pull(df_1, vec_factor))
```

##### What happens, and why? Does this help explain what happens when you try to take the mean?

-   For logical variables, the `as.numeric` function coerses the *logical variables* into *numeric variables*. Specifically, `TRUE` equals 1 and `FALSE` equals 0
-   For character variables, the outcome is `NA` and a warning shows `NAs introduced by coercion`, which means that character variables cannot be coersed into numeric ones. That would explain why the `mean` of the character variables is `NA`
-   For factor variables, the coersion turns them into their levels, and autmatically assigns the factors with levels from 1 to 3.

### Convert logical vector

-   convert the logical vector to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the result
-   convert the logical vector to a factor, and multiply the random sample by the result
-   convert the logical vector to a factor and then convert the result to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the result

``` r
# Convert the logical vector to numeric
log_num = as.numeric(pull(df_1, vec_logical))
log_num * pull(df_1, vec_numeric)
## [1] 0.003548909 0.506075295 0.000000000 1.623122065 0.000000000 0.000000000
## [7] 1.218618412 0.961932420

# Covert the logical vector to a factor
log_fac = factor(pull(df_1, vec_logical))
log_fac * pull(df_1, vec_numeric)
## Warning in Ops.factor(log_fac, pull(df_1, vec_numeric)): '*' not meaningful
## for factors
## [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

# Convert the logical vector to a factor and then convert the result to numeric
log_fac_num = as.numeric(log_fac)
log_fac_num * pull(df_1, vec_numeric)
## [1]  0.007097819  1.012150589 -0.805113345  3.246244130 -1.520726244
## [6] -0.149079511  2.437236823  1.923864840
```

-   logical to numeric: returns numerical values, because `TRUE` equals 1, and `FAlSE` equals 0
-   factor to character to numeric: returns NAs, because when factors are turned into characters, the as.numeric function will return NA for characters
-   character to factor to numeric: returns numerical value, because characters can turned into factors, and then as.numeric assign numbers to each level of the factor

*Problem 2*
===========

This problem focuses the use of inline R code, plotting, and the behavior of `ggplot` for variables of different types.

-   Create a data frame comprised of:
    -   `x`: a random sample of size 500 from a standard Normal distribution
    -   `y`: a random sample of size 500 from a standard Normal distribution
    -   A logical vector indicating whether `x + y > 1`
    -   A numeric vector created by coercing the above logical vector
    -   A factor vector created by coercing the above logical vector
-   Write a short description of your vector using inline R code, including:
    -   the size of the dataset (using `nrow` and `ncol`)
    -   the mean, median, and standard deviation of `x`
    -   the proportion of cases for which `x + y > 1`

### Create a data frame

``` r
set.seed(50) # set.seed() would fix the randomly chosen varibles

df_2 = tibble(
  x = rnorm(n = 500, mean = 0, sd = 1),
  y = rnorm(n = 500, mean = 0, sd = 1),
  vec_logical = (x + y) > 1,
  vec_numeric = as.numeric(vec_logical),
  vec_factor = factor(vec_logical)
)
```

-   The dataset has 500 rows and 5 columns
-   For `x`,
    -   the mean is -0.02
    -   the median is 0.033
    -   the standard deviation is 1.022
-   The proportion of cases for which `x + y > 1` is 0.24

### Scatterplots

Make a scatterplot of y vs x; color points using the logical variable (adding color = ... inside of aes in your ggplot code should help). Make a second and third scatterplot that color points using the numeric and factor variables, respectively, and comment on the color scales.

##### Scatterplot 1

``` r
# Using the logical variable as determinants for different colors
plot_1 = ggplot(df_2, aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_logical)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Color by Logical")
# Using the numeric variable as determinants for different colors
plot_2 = ggplot(df_2, aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_numeric)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Color by Numeric")
# Using the factor variable as determinants for different colors
plot_3 = ggplot(df_2, aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_factor)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Color by Factor")

#Show the plots
plot_1
```
